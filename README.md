Hello there! It's Marcos here 👋

I'm a restless Developer. Currently, I am mainly frontend web dev, studying IT Analyst career, and training for Game Dev 👌🎮

I love design and build Web interfaces🎨, connect those interfaces
with API if it needed🔌, send and receive data to/from Backend🔁, show
dynamic data💻, apply Math🧮, improve UX... Pretty much anything
related with UI🖼

I am a very enthusiastic and curious person👀. Obsessed with the truth
and perfectionist🌟, I really like get and understand every knowledge
and details available. And apply that new stuff in my life and work!💪
